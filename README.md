WEEK5 DAY3 Lab Assignment Summary
In this lab assignment, I built a food selection page using Vue and SCSS. How to structure data in Vue to render multiple items dynamically, and how to create a responsive card-based layout with custom SCSS. This exercise helped me reinforce my understanding of Vue data binding, loops, and component structure, as well as SCSS organization, styling, and layout techniques.
